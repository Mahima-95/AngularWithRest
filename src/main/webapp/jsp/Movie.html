				<p>It is the early 1980s and wrestlers are treated as local heroes.
					 This is yet not the time for gym-toned bodies and common folks like to believe that wrestlers are physically superior to them. 
					 On top of that, Mahavir Singh Phogat is a former national champion.
					 Now a government servant, Phogat, who wears a gold ring and a silver-plated watch, 
					 has a volatile temper and wants a son to carry his legacy forward.<br>
					 Such sentiments have already taken Haryana to the wrong side of the gender equality debate by the beginning of the ’90s.
					 His apologetic wife (Sakshi Tanwar) shows how you start liking your oppressor because there is nowhere else to go.
					 Not so directly, though. 
					 Tanwar’s comic timing tries to deflect the focus from her life to the little girls who are forced to fight the 
					 local chauvinists because their father has decided to transform them into world-class wrestlers.
